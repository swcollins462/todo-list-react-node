React todo list allows user to add todo items, mark items as complete, and delete items. Todo list data is stored in an SQL database hosted on a Node.js server.

Technologies used include:

- HTML
- CSS
- React
- Node.js
- SQL

Future improvements could include:

1. drag-and-drop reordering
2. ability to create multiple todo lists
3. ability for the user to customize styling
